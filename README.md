# Arduino-Sketches
This repo holds my collection of Arduino sketches.
Each folder will contain:
- An .ino file.
- A text file with the libraries and technology used.

## **Setup**
- Clone the repo (Using HTTPS or SSH).
- Navigate to the project folder.
- Read the text file to see what technology/libaries was used.
- Open the .ino file in the Arduino IDE or other.
- Install required libraries.

## **My Arduino**
I have used the Arduino Mega 2560 for all of these projects.
